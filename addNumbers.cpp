//I used programiz to play around with and make a program that adds any amount of numbers
//My first mistake was forgetting the semicolons, very important!
//then I had to edit my pseudocode to have the correct syntax for for loops (initialization; condition; increment)
// I learned that if you don't include the increment for counter, then counter will never equal the counterMax and thus will forever ask for another number without exiting the loop and displaying the total
